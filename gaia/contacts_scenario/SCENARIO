Contacts Scenario
---------------------
A social networking app has the ability to locate friends of the user
using the same service by accessign the user's contacts.

The user wants to use this functionality, but does not want the app to have
access to all the information in the system's contacts store.
---------------------
This app was originally called ScoreGeek, The app requires Read/Write
access to the users contacts to allow the user to easilly connect with
her friends on a board game website.

API Usage
---------------------
The new app utilizes two levels of our api.

1. Access restriction based on views of the database
   -Limitted to certain columns by the app's manifest
   -Limitted further by a where clause input by the user when the
    app is first run

2. Restricts others access by limiting newly created contacts to be
   Private to this app
